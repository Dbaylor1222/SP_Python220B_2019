For this test, I placed 10,000 items in the customers and
rentals csv file and 20,000 items in the products file.
The function to show_rentals took the longest as 
there was nearly 20,000 records found (I purposely used 
only one product ID for most of the 20,000 records). The show_available_products 
function took a little bit shorter time to process with nearly 10,000 records (I 
purposefully made nearly all the rentals the same product number to get almost
10,000 records). The import_data function took the shortest amount of time (8 seconds) 
to process 40,000 records. The show_available_products and show_rentals functions took a lot 
shorter time than import since there was conditional looping involved. It would be interesting
to run show_available_products and show_rentals with the same number of records to see
what happens since show_available_products time was only a little bit shorter than 
show_rentals with nearly half the records.

Metaprogramming was definitely a useful way to implement the timing function 
for each of the functions in database, but I personally find using decorators
more useful as we did in lesson09.
