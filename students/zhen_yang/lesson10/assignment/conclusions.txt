1. We run the program in five different set of input files.
(1) input file has total 5 records
(2) input file has total 100 records
(3) input file has total 1000 records
(4) input file has total 10000 records
(5) input file has total 100000 records
We found that as the number of the records increasing, the computation time
of the program is also increased, especially for the hundred thousand of records.
We also note that function 'import_data()' consume most of the computation time.
It is the bottleneck of our program. Since import_data() is mainly performing
I/O process, so we should consider using multiple-threading to improve the
performance of our program.

2. The timing information is obtained by adding timing decorator to the critical
functions without changing any part of the functions. Other developers can also
use this timing declarator to timing their functions.
