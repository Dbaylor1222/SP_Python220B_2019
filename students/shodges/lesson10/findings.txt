As recorded in timings.txt (and graphed in time-taken.png), we find processing time as it relates to the 
number of records differs on the function.

In the case of importing, the best trendline shows a more linear relationship between number of records and total
import time.  This makes some degree of sense when we consider what the code is doing -- there is some overhead in
setting up the file read operation, and the connector to the database, but following that, we have a straightforward
"read line from CSV, write line to DB".

In the show_available_products() method, we see a more exponential increase in processing time -- again, considering the
code, this makes sense -- each time we get a result from the products table, we look in the rentals table to determine
who's rented the item.  As products increase in number, we expect rentals to increase in number (and in my testing,
they did), so we more rapidly increase processing time as we increase record counts.
