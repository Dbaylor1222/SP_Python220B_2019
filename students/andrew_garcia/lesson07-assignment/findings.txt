Testing the timings between linear and parallel performance, it seems that the timings on my systerm are almost the same. 
Parallel performance is just slightly better than linear performance, so it seems like that would be the better route, but
one of the linear tests was faster than one of the parallel tests, so it does seem like either direction would perform at
about the same speed on my system.
