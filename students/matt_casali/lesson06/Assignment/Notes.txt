Notes for assignment 6

Overview:
1. I began by timing the poor_perf.py script. The script time ranged from roughly 4.5 to 5 seconds to complete.
2. After looking at the resulting dictionary, I noticed the 2018 key was printing 0 due to an error in the code.
3. Some initial issues that stand out at first glance are the file opening twice, and the way the dates are 
counted by iterating over the dates and appending the dates to a list, only to iterate again over that list. 

Changes:
Original time - ~4.75 seconds

1. The first change is to only open the CSV file once. Having the file opened twice is 
redundant and unnecessary. 

After this improvement, the new time runs between 2.9 and 3.1 seconds, an overall 
improvement of ~1.75 seconds. 

New time - ~3 seconds


2. The next change is to modify how the years are counted. I removed the new_ones list as well as the for 
loop that iterates over the new_ones list. I moved the year_count dictionary above the for loop looking
at each row in the CSV, and modified the for loop to simply add to the dictionary for each year it 
iterates over.

Additionally, the count of 'ao' needed to be modified to work  properly. The 'found' count was also
moved above the for loop that iterates over the rows. If 'ao' is found in row 6, found is increased by
1. 

After this improvement, the new time runs between 1.85 and 1.95 seconds, and improvement of ~1.1 seconds 
compared to the last script, and an overall improvement of 2.85 seconds compared to the original script. 

New time - ~1.9 seconds

Conclusions:
Minimizing iterations seems to be key. Try to maximize what is done with the least amount of iterations. 
The same goes for opening files. Do it once, if possible.
