Findings for lesson 07:

Linear 1000 records:
Products: 0.468869 seconds
Customers: 0.439747 seconds
Total run time: 1.36869 seconds

Parallel 1000 records:
Products: 0.6999258 seconds
Customers: 0.7059814 seconds
Total run time: 0.747918 seconds

The results for 1,000 records show that the parallel script ran considerably faster than the
linear script. Since both scripts finished so quickly, I wanted to try the test again with 
more records. I ran the scripts again using 10,000 records. 

Linear 10000 records:
Products: 4.219468 seconds
Customers: 4.220541 seconds
Total run time: 12.57477 seconds

Parallel 10000 records:
Products: 7.111064 seconds
Customers: 7.158852 seconds
Total run time: 7.2007017 seconds

Using 10,000 records, the results were even more apparent. The linear method takes slightly 
over 4 seconds per table to process. This method is adding the product, customer, and rental
table, although the rental table is not getting used. The rental table could be a source of
contention, being that the product and customer tables supply the rental table with customer
and product IDs. There are currently no problems with the test data, but I wanted to try 
this test one more time without the rental table included. 

Linear 10000 records, no rentals:
Products: 4.2900264 seconds
Customers: 4.144063 seconds
Total run time: 8.471657 seconds

Parallel 10000 records, no rentals:
Products: 5.340639 seconds
Customers: 5.351801 seconds
Total run time: 5.386255 seconds

Still, the parallel method is significantly quicker. I believe that the parallel method 
is appropriate in this situation, given only the products and customers tables. However,
I am not sure this will be the best approach when another table that relies on these
two tables, such as the rentals table, is added.
