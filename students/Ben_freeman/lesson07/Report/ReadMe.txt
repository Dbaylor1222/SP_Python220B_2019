We see that as the linear version of the importer seems to do a better job with low number of customers, and as expected
as the order of magnitude of the number of customers rises the relative performance of Linear.py drops in compairson to Parallel.

This is visualized in two graphs, the first one (left) showing the absolute performance of each approach for various numbers of reccords 
and the second (right) showing the reletive performance between the two approaches. As we can see, the linear approach will become the less effective method 
within an order of magnitude or two more records.
