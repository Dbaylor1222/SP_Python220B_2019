ANALYSIS:
The first runs use the timeit function averaged over 20 runs running the entire call to main():

It took an average of 0.555572 seconds over 20 runs and 7.4% of the CPU for the linear case
It took an average of 0.534199 seconds over 20 runs and 6.0% of the CPU for the parallel case

At a ratio of 0.96, both techniques perform approximately equally.
More tests should be considered under different conditions (more data in csv, etc).

Timing the import times of products and customers for both the linear and parallel case we see:

It took 0.0246 seconds to import the linear product data
It took 0.0457 seconds to import the parallel product data
It took 0.0231 seconds to import the linear product data
It took 0.0515 seconds to import the parallel product data

There was a performance decrease of 0.54 times by using threading to import the product data
There was a performance decrease of 0.45 times by using threading to import the customer data

Notes:
Overall, the two programs took equally long to complete all tasks.  However, using
threading to attempt to speed up the import of csv data and load into the database
did not work as expected. 

Recommendations:
At this time, threading does not seem to be the better choice.
