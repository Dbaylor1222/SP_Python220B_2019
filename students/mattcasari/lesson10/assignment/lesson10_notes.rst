Lesson 10 Notes

A timer with a logging function was set up as a metaclass with
a wrapper around the called functions.  When the function is called
, the timer calculates the elapsed time between start and stop of 
the function.  The timing is saved in a file named *timings.txt*

Random data was generated for file lengths of 10, 100, 1000 entries. 
This data was generated by using the random data generator I created
in Lesson 07.

The timing for the function calls for each of the file lengths are
as follows:

+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------------------+
| File Length (# Entries) | Run time (seconds) | Population Rate (samples/sec) |
+=========================+====================+===============================+
|        10               |      0.0239        |            0.00239            |
+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------------------+
|       100               |      0.1715        |            0.00172            |
+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------------------+
|      1000               |      1.802         |            0.001802           |
+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------------------+

It takes 7.2 times as long to import 100 entries as it does 10 entries, and 10.5 times as long to import 1000 entries as it does 100 entires.  

The rate of sample entry into the database appears to have peaked around 100 samples.
The suspected reason that the rate of ingestion at 10 entries is lower than at 100
is most likely due to overhead of calling the functions, open the database, opening
the file, and other task such as that.
