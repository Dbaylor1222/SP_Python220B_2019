Notes:
- I didn't find an existing file for database.py to analyze or add to, so I refactored my 'linear.py' method from previous lessons
  to be conducive to metaprogramming and timing information. 'unobstructive_timing_method' is added to the ImportData class in
  both the __name__ == '__main__' block and in the test_database.py file.

- Because I just rewrote my method for importing the data, the code itself didn't create much timing variation when importing the data


Observations:
- The time appears to scale linearly with the number of records as expected

- Product files took longer than Customer files to import just based on the size of each record

- The Rentals files took the longest to import because of the '.split()' function
