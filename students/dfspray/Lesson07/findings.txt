Notes:
1. Running parallel.py takes around .82 seconds while linear.py takes around .51 seconds with the same imports as Lesson05
2. Running parallel.py used around 2% cpu capacity while linear.py used around .8% cpu capacity with the same imports as Lesson05

Conclusion:
This change is not necessary. The performance of running the imports in parallel was worse than the performance of using a linear 
method in both time and cpu usage.
