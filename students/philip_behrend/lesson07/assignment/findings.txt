It appears that parallel processing does not adequately improve performance
of the module. For the linear case, data import and insertion into MongoDB took
about 0.12 seconds for each file. In the parallel case, the same operation took
about 0.5 seconds due to the fact that a separate function was created to allow for
threading.

It is my recommendation to remain with the linear module in this case.
