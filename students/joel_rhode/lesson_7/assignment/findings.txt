To get meaningful time and attempt to get increased differentiation between linear and parallel
options 10,000 items were used in each csv file (products, rentals, customers).

Time for linear run was found to be (including unused rental import) 1.332 seconds (average across
three runs).

Time for parallel run, using a dedicated thread for each import (reading and placing into database
for rentals, customers, and products), was found to be 1.316 seconds.

Based on the findings above, a parallel threaded solution may provide a very slight benefit, but not
substantial enough to warrant any significant updates to the code.

Threading was selected because the I/O nature of database entry. Multiprocessing was not
investigated.
