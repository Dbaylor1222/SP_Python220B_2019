Lesson 10 Findings:

Varying the `N` constant in test_database.py changes the size of
randomly-generated input data files. This allows for many database
sizes to be tested. 

In `timing.txt`, the tests are logged according to timestamp.
In order, the `N` values were:
    * 1
    * 5
    * 10
    * 50
    * 100
    * 500

This results in input .csv files of approximate lengths of:
    * 5
    * 25
    * 50
    * 250
    * 500
    * 2500
    
As the records involved increases, the time required for
the functions increases as well. The `show_available_products`
and the related `show_products_for_customer`
functions have the highest run times, and their times are 
nearly identical. Each of these functions involve two database 
queries. Importing the data from .csv files is the next longest
function call, but it is substantially quicker than the database
functions.
